# Guess A Number

This is an implementation of a game very similar to the well known tabletop game "Mastermind"
(Hasbro).

The current version smulates the code maker role.

The code maker makes a secret code from a collection of digits (default: 6).

The code breaker (i.e. the other player of two) compares to her secret code and gives feedback,
by 'o' for every digit guessed right and in the code, and '+' if not only color but also
position in the number does fit.
